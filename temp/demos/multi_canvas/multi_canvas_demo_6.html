    <h2><u>Moving a rectangle between non-overlapping (coordinate space) canvases</u></h2>
    <h3>The canvas on the left and right are setup to represent non-overlapping coordinate space (e.g. different bases in Command & Conquer, Warhammer, Rise of Nations). </h3>
    <h3>The canvas on the right has been translated by a canvas width (i.e. 400 pixels) to the right. </h3>
    <h3>Use the 'wasd' keys to drive the rectangle between the two canvases and the 'r' key to reset. </h3>
    <!-- Canvases -->
    <canvas id='game-canvas-left' width='400' height='400'></canvas>
    <canvas id='game-canvas-right' width='400' height='400'></canvas>
