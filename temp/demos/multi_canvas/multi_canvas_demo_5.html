    <h2><u>Individual rotation of more than 1 primitive on same canvas and drawing same rectangles on two canvases</u></h2>
    <h3>Both canvases are drawing the same two primitives. One with a CW (i.e. positive) and one with a CCW (i.e. negative) rotation.</h3>
    <h3>Why draw the same rectangles on the two canvases? In our multi-screen game we will draw the same sprites across 2+ canvases.</h3>
